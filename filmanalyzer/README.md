## Setup

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will install all the required dependencies for the project.

## Running

The following commands are available:

```bash
# run the backend and frontend concurrently (dev)
npm run dev
# run just the backend (dev)
npm run backend:dev
# run just the frontend
npm run frontend:dev
# start app (production)
npm run start
```

The `start` script will simply start the server, which will require a built bundle for the frontend.
